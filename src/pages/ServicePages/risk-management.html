<!-- ============================================ 
    This Stitch is used for content heavy interior pages
    that have no design or layout.  Often times these are 
    content silos where you talk extensively about a topic
    to educate your visitors and rank on Google for the 
    content.  These are great for pages that have a TON
    of content.  Design isn't important here, it's all 
    about making the content accessible and easy to read.

            <h2>Why Risk Management Matters</h2>
            <p>
                Risk is an unavoidable part of life—but it doesn’t have to disrupt your financial future. At Peterson
                Financial, our risk management approach is designed to protect your income, assets, and legacy from the
                unexpected. Whether it's market volatility, health challenges, legal disputes, or business setbacks, we
                help you build a plan that minimizes vulnerability and maximizes peace of mind.
            </p>
            <p>
                From individuals and families to business owners and executives, we work closely with you to understand
                your unique situation and develop strategies that align with your long-term goals.
            </p>

            <p>
                It can help minimize taxes, avoid lengthy probate processes, and reduce the burden on your family during
                difficult times. A well-crafted estate plan gives you control over how your assets are managed and
                distributed. It also allows you to designate trusted individuals to make financial or medical decisions
                on your behalf if you're ever unable to do so.
            </p>
